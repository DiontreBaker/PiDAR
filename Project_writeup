# Summary #
In agriculture, we as engineers combine science and machines to help us use our environment 
more efficiently. At the University of Kentucky, engineering students are creating new inventive 
ways to help farmers and environmentalist alike. This semester our group has taken on the task
of creating a platform for wireless control of a LIDAR scanner mounted on a UAV for measuring
alfalfa plant height. A LIDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging. This device sends pulses
out to measure light frequencies so that the LIDAR can pick up differences in height on the 
ground. The first part of the project is to create a mount for the LIDAR so that it will be secure to 
the drone. Another part of the project is to develop a code for the LIDAR to measure the required data.
